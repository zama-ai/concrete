# What is Concrete?

**Concrete** is an open source framework that simplifies the use of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).

FHE is a powerful technology that enables computations on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it. This capability ensures user privacy and provides robust protection against data breaches, as operations are performed on encrypted data, keeping sensitive information secure even if the server is compromised.

The **Concrete** framework makes writing FHE programs easy for developers by incorporating a Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Torus (TFHE) Compiler based on [LLVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM).


**Concrete** enables developers to efficiently develop privacy-preserving applications for various use cases. For instance, [Concrete ML](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-ml) is built on top of Concrete to integrate privacy-preserving features of FHE into machine learning use cases.

# What is Concrete?

**Concrete** is an open source framework which simplifies the use of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables performing computations on encrypted data directly without the need to decrypt it first. FHE allows developers to build services that ensure privacy for all users. FHE is also an excellent solution against data breaches as everything is performed on encrypted data. Even if the server is compromised, no sensitive data will be leaked.

Since writing FHE programs is difficult, the Concrete framework contains a TFHE Compiler based on [LLVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM) to make this process easier for developers.

Concrete is a versatile library that can be used for a variety of purposes. For instance, [Concrete ML](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-ml) is built on top of Concrete to simplify Machine-Learning oriented use cases.

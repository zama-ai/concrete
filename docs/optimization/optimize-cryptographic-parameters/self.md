## Optimize cryptographic parameters

This guide teaches how to help Concrete Optimizer to select more performant parameters to improve the execution time of Concrete circuits.

The idea is to obtain more optimal cryptographic parameters (especially for table lookups) without changing the operations within the circuit.

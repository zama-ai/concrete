# Optimization

This guide explains how to optimize Concrete circuits extensively.

It's split in 3 sections:
- [Improve parallelism](./improve-parallelism/self.md): to make circuits utilize more cores. 
- [Optimize table lookups](./optimize-table-lookups/self.md): to optimize the most expensive operation in Concrete.
- [Optimize cryptographic parameters](./optimize-cryptographic-parameters/self.md): to make Concrete select more performant parameters.

# Contribute

There are two ways to contribute to **Concrete** tools in general:

* you can open issues to report bugs and typos and to suggest ideas
* you can ask to become an official contributor by emailing hello@zama.ai. Only approved contributors can send pull requests, so please make sure to get in touch before you do!

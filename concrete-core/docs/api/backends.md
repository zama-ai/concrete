# API Structure

`concrete-core` is a modular library based on two main components:

![core_architecture](../_static/core.png)

- The [`specification`](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/specification/index.html) module
contains a blueprint (in the form of Rust Traits) of the FHE scheme exposed in `concrete-core`.
- The `backends` module contains submodules (such a submodule, we call a _backend_ in this document), which implement all or a
part of the specification.

Those backends may rely on different hardware resources, which may not always be available. For this reason,
it is possible to include and exclude backends from a build, by acting on the associated `backend_*` feature
flag.

## Entities and Engines

The `specification` module describes two kinds of objects which can be implemented in a backend.

All the traits appearing in the
[`specification::entities`](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/specification/entities/index.html)
module represent the _datatypes_ manipulated in the library (we call _entities_ all these datatypes we use in
the library). To mention a few of them, we have:
+ [`PlaintextEntity`](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/specification/entities/trait.PlaintextEntity.html)
+ [`LweSecretKeyEntity`](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/specification/entities/trait.LweSecretKeyEntity.html)
+ [`LweCipertextEntity`](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/specification/entities/trait.LweCiphertextEntity.html)
+ and more

Only _one_ of the `*Entity` traits can be implemented at once, by a type exported by a backend. If a structure
implements `PlaintextEntity`, it can not be `LweCiphertextEntity` at the same time, for instance.

All the traits appearing in the
[`specification::engines`](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/specification/engines/index.html)
module represent the _operators_ which can be used to manipulate entities in the library (we call _engines_ 
all these operators we use in the library). For instance, we
have:
+ [`LweSecretKeyCreationEngine`](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/specification/engines/trait.LweSecretKeyCreationEngine.html)
+ [`LweCiphertextEncryptionEngine`](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/specification/engines/trait.LweCiphertextEncryptionEngine.html)
+ [`LweCiphertextDecryptionEngine`](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/specification/engines/trait.LweCiphertextDescryptionEngine.html)
+ and more

If you read between the lines, the fact that we use traits to represent operators, means that we will have to
use special object (which we call _engines_ in this document), to perform the operations. This is
slightly different from an object model in which operators are usually tied to the data themselves. In
practice, this makes sense because we tend to use _side-resources_ to perform operations, and those are better
stored in a separate structure.

Contrary to entities, there is no restrictions on how many `*Engine` traits a type can implement. In practice,
we tend to expose very few engines in a given backend.

## Example backend

Let's go through an example of a backend implementation to illustrate the concepts.

The `core` backend, contains Zama's own cpu based implementation of the scheme. It is located at
[`backends::core`](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/backends/core/index.html). The
associated feature flag is the `backend_core`, but since it is the most prominent backend for now, we include
it automatically (it is part of the `default` flag).

In this core backend, you will find the same structure as in the `specification`:
+ One [`engines`](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/backends/core/engines/index.html) module
  containing the engines exported by the `core` backend
+ One [`entities`](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/backends/core/entities/index.html)
  module containing the entities exported by the `core` backend

In the `entities` module, among other types, we find the
[`LweCiphertext64`](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/backends/core/entities/struct.LweCiphertext64.html)
type. It is an _entity_, which implements the
[`LweCiphertextEntity`](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/specification/entities/trait.LweCiphertextEntity.html)
trait (this type is actually listed in the implementors of the type).

In the `engines` module, we find a single type, which is
[`CoreEngine`](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/backends/core/engines/struct.CoreEngine.html)
. It is an _engine_ which implements many `*Engine` traits, among which the
[`LweCiphertextEncryptionEngine`](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/specification/engines/trait.LweCiphertextEncryptionEngine.html)
trait, or the 
[`LweSecretKeyCreationEngine`](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/specification/engines/trait.LweSecretKeyCreationEngine.html)
trait, both of which are implemented for 32 and 64 bits precisions.

## Operator semantics

As much as possible, we try to support different semantics for each operator in `specification::engines`.

### Pure operators

They take their inputs as arguments, allocate the objects holding the results, and return them.
We call them _pure_ in the sense of pure functions, because they do not have side effects on entities (though
they may have side effects on the engine). These engine traits do not have any particular prefixes in their
names. When non-pure variants of the operator exist, the pure variant tend to require more resources, because
of the allocations it does. Example of such engine traits include:
+ [`LweCiphertextEncryptionEngine`](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/specification/engines/trait.LweCiphertextEncryptionEngine.html)
+ [`LweBootstrapKeyCreationEngine`](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/specification/engines/trait.LweBootstrapKeyCreationEngine.html)

### Discarding operators

They take both their inputs and outputs as arguments. In those operations, the data
originally available in the outputs is not used for the computation. We call them _discarding_ because they
discard the data which exist in the output argument and replace it with something else. The engine traits
following this semantics contain the `Discarding` word in their names. Examples of such engines traits
include:
+ [`LweCiphertextDiscardingAdditionEngine`](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/specification/engines/trait.LweCiphertextDiscardingAdditionEngine.html)
+ [`LweCiphertextDiscardingKeyswitchEngine`](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/specification/engines/trait.LweCiphertextDiscardingKeyswitchEngine.html)

### Fusing operators

They take both their inputs and outputs as arguments. In those operations though, the data
originally contained in the output is used for computation. We call them _fusing_, because they fuse input
arguments into the output argument, which is used in the process (as opposed to _discarded_). The engine
traits which follow this semantics contain the `Fusing` word in their names. Examples of such engines include:
+ [`LweCiphertextFusingAdditionEngine`](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/specification/engines/trait.LweCiphertextFusingAdditionEngine.html)
+ [`LweCiphertextCleartextFusingMultiplicationEngine`](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/specification/engines/trait.LweCiphertextCleartextFusingMultiplicationEngine.html)

## Key distributions

Ciphertexts can be encoded using keys whose data is sampled according to different distributions:
+ Uniform binary
+ Uniform ternary
+ Gaussian

The distribution of the key used to encrypt a ciphertext has a direct impact on which algorithm can be used
on the ciphertext. For this reason, we have a mechanism to ensure, at compile time, that algorithms gets
executed on compatible entities.

This mechanism relies on associating a marker type to keys and ciphertexts. For instance, the
`LweSecretKeyEntity` has an associated `KeyDistribution` type in its definition, which represent which
sampling was used:
```rust
pub trait LweSecretKeyEntity: AbstractEntity<Kind = LweSecretKeyKind> {
    type KeyDistribution: KeyDistributionMarker;
    fn lwe_dimension(&self) -> LweDimension;
}
```

This `KeyDistribution` type must implement `KeyDistributionMarker`, which means it can be one of three types:
+ `BinaryKeyDistribution`
+ `TernaryKeyDistribution`
+ `GaussianKeyDistribution`

Those types are empty and have no other use than representing the distribution of the key in the type system.

The `backends::core::entities::LweSecretKey64` type implements `LweSecretKeyEntity` with the `KeyDistribution`
type equal to `BinaryKeyDistribution` (see
[this line of the doc](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/backends/core/entities/struct.LweSecretKey64.html#associatedtype.KeyDistribution)).
This means that it represents binary lwe secret keys.

Now, if we have a look at the definition of the `LweCiphertextEntity` trait:
```rust
pub trait LweCiphertextEntity: AbstractEntity<Kind = LweCiphertextKind> {
    type KeyDistribution: KeyDistributionMarker;
    fn lwe_dimension(&self) -> LweDimension;
}
```

We can see that it also contains a `KeyDistribution` associated type, which represents which kind of key was
used when encrypting the ciphertext.

The `backends::core::entities::LweCiphertext64` type implements `LweCiphertextEntity` with the
`KeyDistribution` type also equals to `BinaryKeyDistribution` (see
[this line of the doc](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/backends/core/entities/struct.LweCiphertext64.html#associatedtype.KeyDistribution)).
This means that it represents an lwe ciphertext encoded with a binary key.

Most importantly, the definition of `LweCiphertextEncryptionEngine` looks like this:
```rust
pub trait LweCiphertextEncryptionEngine<SecretKey, Plaintext, Ciphertext>: AbstractEngine where
    SecretKey: LweSecretKeyEntity,
    Plaintext: PlaintextEntity,
    Ciphertext: LweCiphertextEntity<KeyDistribution = SecretKey::KeyDistribution>, {
    ...
}
```

If you focus on the trait bounds, you can see
`Ciphertext: LweCiphertextEntity<KeyDistribution = SecretKey::KeyDistribution>`. This bounds prevents
implementing `LweCiphertextEncryptionEngine` for two generic types `SecretKey` and `Ciphertext` with
incompatible key distribution.

Considering the `backends::core::engines::CoreEngine` type, it implements `LweCiphertextEncryptionEngine` for
`SecretKey=LweSecretKey64` and `Ciphertext=LweCiphertext64` which have the same `KeyDistribution` associated
type.

## Error Management

Every `*Engine` trait is tied to a special `*Error` of the same name. For instance,
`LweCiphertextVectorFusingAdditionEngine` is tied to the `LweCiphertextVectorFusingAdditionError` enum whose
definition is:
```rust
pub enum LweCiphertextVectorFusingAdditionError<EngineError: Error> {
    LweDimensionMismatch,    // General error case
    CiphertextCountMismatch, // General error case
    Engine(EngineError),     // Engine-specific error case
}
```

This error is returned by the engine, if an error occurred while performing the operation. The two first error
cases are _general_, in the sense that they can be produced by any engine implementing
`LweCiphertextVectorFusingAdditionEngine`. The last error case is a placeholder for an `EngineError` type
parameter, associated to the engine itself. This `EngineError` will be different for any engine, and contains
error cases specific to a given engine.

## Unchecked operators entry points

Every `*Engine` trait has two entry points:
+ One _safe_ entry point, which returns a `Result<SomeType, SomeError>`
+ One _unsafe_ entry point, which only returns `SomeType`, and is suffixed with `_unchecked`

For instance, here is the declaration of the `LweCiphertextEncryptionEngine`:
```rust
pub trait LweCiphertextEncryptionEngine<SecretKey, Plaintext, Ciphertext>: AbstractEngine where
    SecretKey: LweSecretKeyEntity,
    Plaintext: PlaintextEntity,
    Ciphertext: LweCiphertextEntity<KeyDistribution = SecretKey::KeyDistribution>, {
    fn encrypt_lwe_ciphertext(
        &mut self,
        key: &SecretKey,
        input: &Plaintext,
        noise: Variance
    ) -> Result<Ciphertext, LweCiphertextEncryptionError<Self::EngineError>>;
    unsafe fn encrypt_lwe_ciphertext_unchecked(
        &mut self,
        key: &SecretKey,
        input: &Plaintext,
        noise: Variance
    ) -> Ciphertext;
}
```

Both of them perform the same operation, but the safe entry points will check that all the preconditions on
which the operator rely are verified, and return a descriptive error if this is not the case.

We chose to mark the unchecked entry point with the `unsafe` keyword, to bring the attention of the users on
the operator documentation. If you want to use those, you have to take it on you to ensure that the
documented preconditions hold before calling the operator.

## Memory Management

At the opposite of what is done in the rest of the Rust world, the `concrete-core` api relies on _manual_
memory management. Allocation is usually done with pure entry points, like in the case of
`LweCiphertextEncryptionEngine`, which returns a fresh `LweCiphertextEntity`. For deallocation, the engines
which allocates entities should provide an implementation of the
[`DestructionEngine`](https://docs.rs/concrete-core/latest/concrete_core/specification/engines/trait.DestructionEngine.html)
trait to deallocate the entity.

This choice is very unconventional in Rust, but it has its reasons. The first reason is that some backends are
expected to rely on external devices such as GPU or FPGA. Those resources may have their own memory, separated
from the CPU memory, and hence, the rust global allocator will not be able to manage it. For this reason,
in the case of engines relying on external devices, the simplest thing to do is to turn the engine into an
allocator, and let the user deal with it. Another reason is that `concrete-core` was designed to be exposed to
other languages through different bindings, among which a C binding. It is simpler to develop this C binding
if destruction is already a first class citizen of the API.

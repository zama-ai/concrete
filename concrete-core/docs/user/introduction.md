# Introduction

Welcome to the `concrete-core` guide !

This library contains a set of fast, low-level primitives which can be used to implement *Fully Homomorphic 
Encryption* (FHE) programs. In a nutshell, FHE makes it possible to perform arbitrary computations over 
encrypted data. With FHE, you can perform computations without putting your trust on third-party computation 
providers.

## Quick start

Here is a quick example of how the library can be used to encrypt an integer and decrypt it:

```rust
extern crate concrete_core;
extern crate concrete_commons;

use concrete_commons::dispersion::Variance;
use concrete_commons::parameters::LweDimension;
use concrete_core::prelude::*;

// DISCLAIMER: the parameters used here are only for demo purposes, and are not secure.
let lwe_dimension = LweDimension(630);
// Here a hard-set encoding is applied (shift by 20 bits)
let input = 3_u32 << 20;
let noise = Variance(2_f64.powf(-25.));

let mut engine = CoreEngine::new().unwrap();
let key: LweSecretKey32 = engine.create_lwe_secret_key(lwe_dimension).unwrap();
let plaintext = engine.create_plaintext(&input).unwrap();
let ciphertext = engine.encrypt_lwe_ciphertext(&key, &plaintext, noise).unwrap();

let decrypted_plaintext = engine.decrypt_lwe_ciphertext(&key, &ciphertext).unwrap();

engine.destroy(key).unwrap();
engine.destroy(plaintext).unwrap();
engine.destroy(ciphertext).unwrap();
engine.destroy(decrypted_plaintext).unwrap();
```

## Audience

The goal of `concrete-core` is to be the intermediate layer where library writers and compiler makers, can
access a breadth of fast primitives developed by researchers and hardware designers. As such, this guide
contains two kinds of tutorials geared towards this two categories of users.

### Contributors to the public API

If you are a researcher working on a fast FHE algorithm, or a hardware designer who want to accelerate an
existing algorithm, you can contribute your code to `concrete-core`. What this gives you is:
+ The `concrete-benchmark` application, which allows to benchmark your implementation in minutes, and compare
the results with the existing implementations.
+ The `concrete-test` application, which allows to easily test your implementation, to verify that your
implementation is correct.
+ Exposure to external users, which can easily access your implementation, and integrate it within their
library or compiler.

If you are interested in contributing new algorithms, or new hardware accelerations to `concrete-core`,
proceed to the [Contributor Guide](../dev/index.rst) section !

### Consumers of the public API

If you are writing a library or a compiler for FHE, you can rely on the public API of `concrete-core` to
access a large set of homomorphic operators. To properly use those operators though, you have to know your way
around FHE. The API gives you the freedom to control multiple parameters, which can lead to less than 128
bits of security if chosen incorrectly. As a rule of thumb, if you did not carefully study the mathematical
foundations of FHE, `concrete-core` is probably too low-level for you to use. Fortunately, we propose multiple
libraries that build on top of `concrete-core` and which propose a safer API. To see which one suits your
needs best, see the [concrete homepage](https://zama.ai/concrete).

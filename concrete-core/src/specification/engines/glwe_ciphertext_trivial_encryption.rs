/// A trait for engines trivially encrypting GLWE ciphertext.
///
/// # Semantics
///
/// This [pure](super#operation-semantics) operation generates a GLWE ciphertext containing the
/// trivial encryption of the `input` plaintext vector with the requested `glwe_size`.
///
/// # Formal Definition
///
/// A trivial encryption uses a zero mask and no noise.
/// It is absolutely not secure, as the body contains a direct copy of the plaintext.
/// However, it is useful for some FHE algorithms taking public information as input. For
/// example, a trivial GLWE encryption of a public lookup table is used in the bootstrap.

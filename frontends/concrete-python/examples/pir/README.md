# Private information retrieval

In this example, we present some experiments about PIR made with Concrete, as well as a use-case to access a database to ask if a phone number is a spam, without revealing the phone number. It can be compared with Apple's recent [study and open-source code](https://github.com/apple/live-caller-id-lookup-example).

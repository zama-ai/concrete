*EXEMPTION: ZAMA grants to the user a non-exclusive, free and non-commercial license on all
patents filed in its name relating to the open-source code (the “Patents”) for the sole
purpose of development, research, prototyping and experimentation. It is agreed that ZAMA
will support the user and the community to use, develop and improve Patents and the open-source
code. As a counterpart, the user undertakes to collaborate and share information with ZAMA
regarding any use, developments or improvements, whether protectable or not, of the exploited
Patents and open-source code. In this context it is agreed that the user will declare to ZAMA,
in writing and within a reasonable time, his/her wish to file any intellectual property right,
including in particular any patent or copyright application, relating to the open-source code
and/or the Patents. All declarations shall occur before the application is filed. Further to
this declaration, ZAMA will continue to support the user in the development, research,
prototyping and experimentation and may grant him the right to file the intellectual property
right.

# Concrete Protocol
# 
# The following document contains a programatic description of a communication protocol to store and 
# exchange data with applications of the concrete framework. 
#
# Todo:
#   + Use `storagePrecision` instead of `integerPrecision` to better differentiate between the 
#     message and the storage.
#   + Use `storageInfo` instead of `rawInfo`.

## About

### What is Concrete
**Concrete** is an open-source FHE Compiler that simplifies the use of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Concrete framework contains a TFHE Compiler based on LLVM, making writing FHE programs an easy task for developers. 

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables performing computations on encrypted data directly without the need to decrypt it first. FHE allows developers to build services that ensure privacy for all users. FHE is also an excellent solution against data breaches as everything is performed on encrypted data. Even if the server is compromised, no sensitive data will be leaked.

Concrete is a versatile library that can be used for a variety of purposes. For instance, [Concrete ML](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-ml) is built on top of Concrete to simplify Machine-Learning oriented use cases.

## Getting Started

###  Installation
Depending on your OS, Concrete may be installed with Docker or with pip:

|               OS / HW                       | Available on Docker | Available on PyPI |
| :-----------------------------------------: | :-----------------: | :--------------: |
|                Linux                        |         Yes         |       Yes        |
|               Windows                       |         Yes         |        No        |
|     Windows Subsystem for Linux             |         Yes         |       Yes        |
|            macOS 11+ (Intel)                |         Yes         |       Yes        |
| macOS 11+ (Apple Silicon: M1, M2, etc.)     |      Coming soon    |       Yes        |


#### Pip
The preferred way to install Concrete is through PyPI:

```shell
pip install -U pip wheel setuptools
pip install concrete-python
```

**Note:** Not all versions are available on PyPI. If you need a version that is not on PyPI (including nightly releases), you can install it from our package index by adding `--extra-index-url https://pypi.zama.ai`.

#### Docker
You can get the concrete-python docker image by pulling the latest docker image:

```shell
docker pull zamafhe/concrete-python:v2.0.0
```

*Find more detailed installation instructions in [this part of the documentation](https://docs.zama.ai/concrete/getting-started/installing)*

### A simple example
To compute on encrypted data, you first need to define the function you want to compute, then compile it into a Concrete Circuit, which you can use to perform homomorphic evaluation.
Here is the full example:

```python
from concrete import fhe

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

compiler = fhe.Compiler(add, {"x": "encrypted", "y": "encrypted"})

inputset = [(2, 3), (0, 0), (1, 6), (7, 7), (7, 1), (3, 2), (6, 1), (1, 7), (4, 5), (5, 4)]

print(f"Compilation...")
circuit = compiler.compile(inputset)

print(f"Key generation...")
circuit.keygen()

print(f"Homomorphic evaluation...")
encrypted_x, encrypted_y = circuit.encrypt(2, 6)
encrypted_result = circuit.run(encrypted_x, encrypted_y)
result = circuit.decrypt(encrypted_result)

assert result == add(2, 6)
```
*This example is explained in more detail [in this part of the documentation](https://docs.zama.ai/concrete/getting-started/quick_start).*

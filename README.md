The `concrete` ecosystem is a set of crates that implements Zama's variant of
[TFHE](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/421.pdf). In a nutshell,
[fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption), allows
you to perform computations over encrypted data, allowing you to implement Zero Trust services.

Concrete is based on the
[Learning With Errors (LWE)](https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/papers/lwesurvey.pdf) and the
[Ring Learning With Errors (RLWE)](https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/230.pdf) problems, which are well
studied cryptographic hardness assumptions believed to be secure even against quantum computers.

## Concrete crates

Concrete is implemented using the [Rust Programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), which
allows very fast, yet very secure implementations.

The ecosystem is composed of several crates (packages in the Rust language).
The crates are split into 2 repositories:

- The `concrete` repository which contains crates intended to be more approachable by
non-cryptographers.
- The [concrete-core](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-core) repository which contains the crates
  implementing the low level cryptographic primitives.

The crates within this repository are:
- [`concrete`](concrete): A high-level library, useful to cryptographers that want to quickly
  implement homomorphic applications, without having to understand the details of the
  jmplementation.
- [`concrete-boolean`](concrete-boolean): A high-level library, implementing homomorphic Boolean gates, making it easy
  to run any kind of circuits over encrypted data.
- [`concrete-shortint`](concrete-shortint): A high-level library, implementing operations on short integers (about 1 to 4 bits).
- [`concrete-integer`](concrete-integer): A high-level library, implementing operations on integers, construction on top of short integers for values in about 4 to 16 bits.

## Installation

As `concrete` relies on `concrete-core`, `concrete` is only supported on `x86_64 Linux` and `x86_64 macOS`.
Windows users can use `concrete` through the `WSL`. For Installation instructions see [Install.md](INSTALL.md)
or [documentation](https://docs.zama.ai/concrete).

## Getting Started

Here is a simple example of an encrypted addition between two encrypted 8-bit variables. For more
information please read the [documentation](https://docs.zama.ai/concrete).

```rust
use concrete::{ConfigBuilder, generate_keys, set_server_key, FheUint8};
use concrete::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let config = ConfigBuilder::all_disabled()
        .enable_default_uint8()
        .build();

    let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);

    set_server_key(server_key);

    let clear_a = 27u8;
    let clear_b = 128u8;

    let a = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_a, &client_key);
    let b = FheUint8::encrypt(clear_b, &client_key);

    let result = a + b;

    let decrypted_result: u8 = result.decrypt(&client_key);

    let clear_result = clear_a + clear_b;

    assert_eq!(decrypted_result, clear_result);
}
```

libraries.

## Disclaimers

### Security Estimation

Security estimation, in this repository, used to be based on
the [LWE Estimator](https://bitbucket.org/malb/lwe-estimator/src/master/),
with `reduction_cost_model = BKZ.sieve`.
We are currently moving to the [Lattice Estimator](https://github.com/malb/lattice-estimator)
with `red_cost_model = reduction.RC.BDGL16`.

When a new update is published in the Lattice Estimator, we update parameters accordingly.

### Side-Channel Attacks

Mitigation for side channel attacks have not yet been implemented in Concrete,
and will be released in upcoming versions.
